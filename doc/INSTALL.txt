  java -classpath bin:lib/jetty-continuation.jar:lib/jetty-http.jar:lib/jetty-io.jar:lib/jetty-server.jar:lib/jetty-util.jar:lib/servlet.jar:lib/log4j.jar:resources:lib/postgresql-jdbc.jar org.selliott.atm.server.Main resources/atm.properties
   or use the Ant build to start it:
  ant server

To run the ATM client follow these steps:
