1) To test the ATM server web interface without the benefit of the ATM client curl can be used:
  curl -v -X POST -T doc/example-request.xml http://localhost:8080/atm > /tmp/example-response.xml
   if the database has the expected test data in in the result can be compared to the provided expected response:
  diff /tmp/example-response.xml doc

2) If the schema has been changed the database dump should be updated.  Only PostgreSQL is shown at this time:
  pg_dump -xOU atm -h localhost atm > resources/atm-postgresql.sql
